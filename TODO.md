1. Port the logic to python
2. make a shell-style gui (ideas) similar to tortoise-series (or web interface, see what the NAS guys have)
3. make it also understand btrfs (in my paeanoia, so that all zfs'ed is also btrfsed, just in case
4. provide a way to view cronjobs (like zfs-auto-snapshot) and im/export/launch them
